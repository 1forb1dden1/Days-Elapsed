# Days-Elapsed
This program calculates the total days that has elapsed since January 1st 1900. The program doesn't actually calculate the Julian Date. This project is something I did for my class and is written procedurally. Even though this program is written in a very disorganized way. I really enjoyed this project as it helped me a lot with understanding of
functions and it allowed me even improve my problem solving skills. This was probably the first project that I really had to take time to put together.
